What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   Initialising a repository creates a .git directory. This makes my directory
   into a repository. Now, this is useful because can now save commits into this
   .git folder. So I can track things and make good use of version-control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

  Staging area is an intermediate step.

What value do you think it offers?

   It allows more flexibility with what to commit. So if have many 
   files, instead of commmiting each file separately, can pick and choose
   which file to add to staging area then afterwards can commit everything in 
   staging area at once. So one commit per many files. Helps with 
   multiple files tracking.

change?
